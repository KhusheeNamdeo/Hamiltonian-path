# Hamiltonian-path

Consider you are a tourist and you want to visit a bunch of landmarks, you start from your hotel and want to tour different places and come back to the hotel, 
without visiting the same place twice. This is called a Hamiltonian Path on a graph.
How will you find such a path? You can use the following graph representation "tour.txt", where the first line is the number of nodes, then there is a list of the nodes with 
their names, and then the edges connecting the nodes.
